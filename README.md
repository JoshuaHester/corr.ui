This is a modular user interface construction library for java programs.

It makes heavy use of the [Command Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern) to link buttons to actions automatically using lamda expressions.

The format for doing so is:
  addButton(buttonName,() -> buttonFunction)
  
 The library contains a class "Demo" to demonstrate funcionality
